There are two types of overloading
    ->Fuction Overloading
    ->Operator Overloading


*Operator Overloading*
->Unary Operator
    ->Class Fn
        /*class name
            {
                returntype operator op()
                //no argument
            };
        */     
    ->Friend Fn
        /*        friend returntype operator op(argument list)
                //single argument
        */

->Binary Operator
    ->Class Fn
        /*class name
        {
            returntype operator op(argument list)
            //single argument
        }
        */
    ->Friend Fn
        //friend returntype operator op(argument ,agrument)


NOTE: Any operator can be overloaded except Scope resolution operator (::),
      sizeof() operator and condition operator
