// Explicit Conversion:
//When the user manually changes data from one type to another, this is known as explicit conversion. This type of conversion is also known as type casting.

#include<stdio.h>
main(){
   int i=40;
   short a;
   //Explicit conversion
   a=(short)i;
   printf("explicit value:%d
",a);
